# Wealth of Nations Data Analysis Project 📊🌎

Welcome to my Wealth of Nations Data Analysis project repository! This project showcases my data analysis skills using Excel and Tableau to explore insights from the Wealth of Nations dataset.

## Project Overview ✨
In this project, I worked with a dataset that contains various socioeconomic metrics from different countries. My goal was to clean, filter, and sort the data to extract meaningful insights. I then used Excel to create visualizations and ensure the data was protected 🔐. Afterward, I imported the dataset into Tableau to create an interactive dashboard with multiple visuals.

## Project Components 📋
1. **Data Cleaning and Transformation (Excel)**
   - Cleaned the dataset by removing inconsistencies and missing values 🧹.
   - Filtered and sorted the data to focus on key metrics 🔍.
   - Created charts to visualize important relationships within the data 📈.
   - Implemented Excel file protection to maintain data integrity 🔒.

2. **Interactive Dashboard (Tableau)**
   - Imported the cleaned dataset into Tableau.
   - Developed a dashboard containing four interactive visuals to explore:
     - **GDP vs. Smartphone Users**: A scatter plot that shows the correlation between GDP and the number of smartphone users in different countries 📊.
     - **Life Expectancy at Birth**: A bar chart comparing life expectancy across different countries 🏥.
     - **Number of Smartphone Users**: A line chart illustrating the trend of smartphone usage over time 📱.
     - **GDP Distribution**: A pie chart displaying the distribution of GDP among various countries 🥧.
   - Integrated filtering and tooltips for an enhanced user experience 🎯.

## How to Use 🛠️
1. **Excel Workbook**
   - Open the Excel workbook to view the cleaned dataset and the charts created for data exploration.
   - Ensure you have the appropriate permissions to access the protected workbook 🔑.

2. **Tableau Dashboard**
   - Open the Tableau dashboard to interact with the various visuals.
   - Use the filters to adjust the data being displayed according to your interests.
   - Hover over data points to view additional information via tooltips 💡.
